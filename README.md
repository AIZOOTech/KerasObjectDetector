As a 2019 Open Source Countibuthon Project, we create Kears Object Detection API.  
The purpose of Keras Object Detection API is to make it easy and fast so that everyone can create their own Object Detection model without difficulty.  
Detailed instructions for use will be updated at a later. You can look forward to it. ðŸ¤“
