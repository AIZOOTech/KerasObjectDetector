# Let's Detect Obejcts by Keras API

## Introduction
__Object Detection__ is one of the most popular computer vision technologies in many areas.(Face detection, Self-driving car etc) Recently, __Deep Learning__ technology has greatly influenced the Object Detection field, such as accuracy, performance improvement. 
There are several popular deep learning algorithms. __Faster R-CNN(2015)__, __YOLO(2015)__, __SSD(2015)__ and __RetinaNet(2017)__. In this tutorial, we will  __Faster R-CNN(2015)__ to learn what object detection is. 

#### _What's Faster R-CNN?_
[Faster R-CNN(2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf) is one of the R-CNN models that extracts Region Proposals and classifies them on the basis of CNN models.


#### _What's Deepfashion2?_
 In fact, many object detection tutorials use famous dataset such as [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/), [VOC2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) etc. But, this tutorial uses [DeepFashion2(2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07973.pdf). DeepFashion2 is comprehensive fashion dataset that contains 491k images, each of which is richly labeled with style, scale, occlusion, zooming, viewpoint, bounding box, dense landmarks and pose, pixel-level masks, and pair of images of identical item from consumer and commercial store.
